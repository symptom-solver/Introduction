# Software as a Medical Device: SymptomSolver

## Introduction
Welcome to the documentation for the Symptom Solver application. This document provides an overview of our innovative medical software designed to assist users in identifying potential illnesses based on reported symptoms.

## Project Overview
The Symptom Solver application utilizes a decision tree model trained on a comprehensive dataset to map symptoms to potential diseases. This empowers users to receive preliminary diagnostic insights conveniently from any location. Developed under the agile Scrum methodology, our approach ensures iterative development, responsiveness to evolving requirements, and delivery of a robust web application accessible across multiple devices.

## Key Components
1. **Frontend Application**: Enables users to input symptoms and receive a list of potential diseases.
2. **Backend System**: Processes symptom data using a decision tree classifier to match symptoms with diseases based on probability.
3. **Infrastructure as Code**: Supports seamless deployment and scalability of both frontend and backend components.

Technical deliverables include a fully functional web application, a scalable backend system, and automated deployment scripts.

## Methodology
Our development strictly adheres to the IEC 62304 standard for medical device software, ensuring compliance with rigorous safety and effectiveness guidelines. Each sprint is meticulously planned, executed, and reviewed to maintain alignment with our development objectives.
